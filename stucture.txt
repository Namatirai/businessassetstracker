Creating an application to track business assets involves several steps, including defining classes, establishing relationships, implementing OOP principles, and implementing various functionalities. Let's break it down step by step:

Step 1: Define Classes
Business Class:

Properties: name, salaryCosts, overheadCosts, totalSales, totalProfit.
Methods: calculateTotalProfit(), addAsset(Asset asset), etc.
Asset Class:

Properties: name, totalExpenditure, totalLosses, weeklyData (list of weekly data).
Methods: calculateWeeklyExpenditure(), calculateWeeklyProfit(), addWeeklyData(WeeklyData data), etc.
WeeklyData Class:

Properties: weekStartDate, weekEndDate, expenses, profits.
Chicken Class:

Properties: name, cost, feedExpenses, medicineExpenses, sales.
Methods: calculateWeeklyExpenditure(), calculateWeeklyProfit(), etc.
Property Class:

Properties: name, buildingCost, incomeGenerated.
Methods: calculateWeeklyExpenditure(), calculateWeeklyProfit(), etc.
Step 2: Establish Relationships
A Business can have multiple Assets. (One-to-Many relationship)
Each Asset belongs to one Business. (Many-to-One relationship)
Chicken, Property, and other asset types can extend the Asset class.
Step 3: Implement OOP Concepts
Encapsulation: Use private fields and provide public methods to access and modify them.
Inheritance: Utilize inheritance where applicable, like extending specific asset types from the general Asset class.
Polymorphism: Implement methods with the same name but different behavior based on the asset type.
Abstraction: Define interfaces or abstract classes for common functionalities.
Step 4: Implement Functionality
Logging Existing Assets:

Create methods to view existing assets in the UI.
Adding/Removing Assets:

Implement methods to add and remove assets in the Business class.
Logging Asset Data in Weekly Format:

Create a method in Asset to add weekly data (WeeklyData objects) to the list.
Different Types of Assets:

Create specific classes (e.g., Chicken, Property) that extend the Asset class.
Weekly Expenditure and Profit Calculation:

Implement methods in each asset type to calculate weekly expenditure and profit.
Step 5: UI (User Interface)
Depending on your preference (web or desktop), create an interface for users to interact with the application. This could be a web-based frontend using HTML/CSS/React or a desktop application using JavaFX/Swing.
Step 6: Testing
Write unit tests to ensure that your classes and methods work as expected.
Step 7: Integration and Deployment
Integrate the frontend with the backend (if applicable) and deploy the application.
Remember to continuously test and refine your application. This outline provides a starting point, and you may need to make adjustments based on your specific requirements and technologies you choose to use.
